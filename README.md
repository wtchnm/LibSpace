## Project Goals

This project was built to explore a **server-first, progressively enhanced** architecture for modern web applications. The key objectives were:

- **Minimize Client-Side Complexity:** Build a robust and secure application by handling authentication, sessions, and data mutations almost entirely on the server.
- **Embrace Progressive Enhancement:** Ensure the core experience is functional with zero JavaScript, while layering on modern, real-time features for capable browsers.
- **Prioritize Developer Experience:** Leverage end-to-end type safety and a component-based architecture to create a maintainable and scalable codebase.
